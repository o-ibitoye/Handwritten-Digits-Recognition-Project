# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition-Project

This project of handwritten digits character recognition, also known as optical character recognition (OCR), is important for several reasons including document digitization, form processing, banking and finance, handwritten-based user authentication and so on. The task here is to correctly classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset can be found at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
