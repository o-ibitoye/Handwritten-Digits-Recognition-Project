# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition-Project

This project on handwritten digits character recognition, also known as optical character recognition (OCR), is important for several reasons, including document digitization, form processing, banking and finance, handwritten-based user authentication, etc. The task here is to correctly classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset can be found at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
